## About

Femicide Algeria is a digital memorial and awareness platform dedicated to documenting cases of femicide and gender-based violence in Algeria. This project serves as both a tribute to victims and a call for societal change.

### Our Mission

- **Remember the Victims**: Honor the lives lost to gender-based violence
- **Raise Awareness**: Shine light on the epidemic of violence against women
- **Challenge Culture**: Confront victim-blaming attitudes and toxic cultural norms
- **Demand Justice**: Advocate for stronger legal protections and accountability

## The Reality

Violence against women in Algeria remains largely underreported and systematically ignored. Cultural attitudes that blame victims, shame families into silence, and normalize domestic violence perpetuate this crisis. This platform breaks that silence.

### What We Document

- Individual victim stories and memorials
- Statistical analysis of femicide cases
- Cultural factors contributing to violence
- Resources for survivors and families

## Features

- **Memorial Wall**: Interactive tribute to victims with their stories

## Built With

- **React** - Frontend framework
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling and responsive design
- **Modern Web Technologies** - For optimal user experience

## Contributing

- Advocates and activists
- Survivors and families
- Developers and designers
- Feminist organizations.
